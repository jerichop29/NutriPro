## Features  

NutriPro can:  
1. Detect and classify vegetables in images and real-time video.  
2. Evaluate vegetable quality on a scale of 1 to 9, where:  
   - **8–9** represents excellent quality.  
   - **6–7** represents good quality.  
   - **1–5** represents fair to poor quality.  
3. Estimate vegetable weight using computer vision and physics-based formulas:  
   - **Dimension estimation** using segmentation.  
   - **Distance tracking** for accurate size calculations.  
   - **Weight measurement** based on physics-based calculations.  
4. Track vegetable spoilage and send notifications before spoilage occurs.  
5. Display results, including quality grade, weight, nutritional facts, and a description of the quality, in a user-friendly interface.  
6. Integrate with the **YOLOv8 Algorithm** for accurate detection.
